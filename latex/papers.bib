  abstract={This paper describes an algorithm for computing the distribution of conditional forecasts, i.e., projections of a set of variables of interest on future paths of some other variables, in dynamic systems. The algorithm is based on Kalman filtering methods and is computationally viable for large models that can be cast in a linear state space representation. We build large vector autoregressions (VARs) and a large dynamic factor model (DFM) for a quarterly data set of 26 euro area macroeconomic and financial indicators. The two approaches deliver similar forecasts and scenario assessments. In addition, conditional forecasts shed light on the stability of the dynamic relationships in the euro area during the recent episodes of financial turmoil, and indicate that only a small number of sources drive the bulk of the fluctuations in the euro area economy.},

    abstract = { We consider the problem of implementing simple and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation algorithms for state space models. A conceptually transparent derivation of the posterior distribution of the states is discussed, which also leads to an efficient simulation algorithm that is modular, scalable and widely applicable. We also discuss a simple approach for evaluating the integrated likelihood, defined as the density of the data given the parameters but marginal of the state vector. We show that this high-dimensional integral can be easily evaluated with minimal computational and conceptual difficulty. Two empirical applications in macroeconomics demonstrate that the methods are versatile and computationally undemanding. In one application, involving a time-varying parameter model, we show that the methods allow for efficient handling of large state vectors. In our second application, involving a dynamic factor model, we introduce a new blocking strategy which results in improved MCMC mixing at little cost. The results demonstrate that the framework is simple, flexible and efficient. }

It also surveys recent developments in methods for identifying and estimating SVARs, an area that has seen important developments over the past 15 years. The chapter begins by introducing DFMs and the associated statistical tools, both parametric (state-space forms) and nonparametric (principal components and related methods). After reviewing two mature applications of DFMs, forecasting and macroeconomic monitoring, the chapter lays out the use of DFMs for analysis of structural shocks, a special case of which is factor-augmented vector autoregressions (FAVARs). A main focus of the chapter is how to extend methods for identifying shocks in structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to structural DFMs. The chapter provides a unification of SVARs, FAVARs, and structural DFMs and shows both in theory and through an empirical application to oil shocks how the same identification strategies can be applied to each type of model.},

This book presents recent advances in econometric methods that make feasible the estimation of models that have both features. One approach, in the classical framework, approximates the likelihood function; the other, in the Bayesian framework, uses Gibbs-sampling to simulate posterior distributions from data. The authors present numerous applications of these approaches in detail: decomposition of time series into trend and cycle, a new index of coincident economic indicators, approaches to modeling monetary policy uncertainty, Friedman's \&quot;plucking\&quot; model of recessions, the detection of turning points in the business cycle and the question of whether booms and recessions are duration-dependent, state-space models with heteroskedastic disturbances, fads and crashes in financial markets, long-run real exchange rates, and mean reversion in asset returns.},

  abstract={A class of global-local hierarchical shrinkage priors for estimating large Bayesian vector autoregressions (BVARs) has recently been proposed. We question whether three such priors: Dirichlet-Laplace, Horseshoe, and Normal-Gamma, can systematically improve the forecast accuracy of two commonly used benchmarks (the hierarchical Minnesota prior and the stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) prior), when predicting key macroeconomic variables. Using small and large data sets, both point and density forecasts suggest that the answer is no. Instead, our results indicate that a hierarchical Minnesota prior remains a solid practical choice when forecasting macroeconomic variables. In light of existing optimality results, a possible explanation for our finding is that macroeconomic data is not sparse, but instead dense.},

We explain how to use DSGE models for all three purposes – forecasting, story-telling, and policy experiments – and review their forecasting record. We also provide our own real-time assessment of the forecasting performance of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model data up to 2011, compare it with Blue Chip and Greenbook forecasts, and show how it changes as we augment the standard set of observables with external information from surveys (nowcasts, interest rates, and long-run inflation and output growth expectations). We explore methods of generating forecasts in the presence of a zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates and conditional on counterfactual interest rate paths. Finally, we perform a post-mortem of DSGE model forecasts of the Great Recession, and show that forecasts from a version of the Smets–Wouters model augmented by financial frictions and with interest rate spreads as an observable compare well with Blue Chip forecasts.}
