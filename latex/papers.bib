  abstract={This paper describes an algorithm for computing the distribution of conditional forecasts, i.e., projections of a set of variables of interest on future paths of some other variables, in dynamic systems. The algorithm is based on Kalman filtering methods and is computationally viable for large models that can be cast in a linear state space representation. We build large vector autoregressions (VARs) and a large dynamic factor model (DFM) for a quarterly data set of 26 euro area macroeconomic and financial indicators. The two approaches deliver similar forecasts and scenario assessments. In addition, conditional forecasts shed light on the stability of the dynamic relationships in the euro area during the recent episodes of financial turmoil, and indicate that only a small number of sources drive the bulk of the fluctuations in the euro area economy.},

    abstract = { We consider the problem of implementing simple and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation algorithms for state space models. A conceptually transparent derivation of the posterior distribution of the states is discussed, which also leads to an efficient simulation algorithm that is modular, scalable and widely applicable. We also discuss a simple approach for evaluating the integrated likelihood, defined as the density of the data given the parameters but marginal of the state vector. We show that this high-dimensional integral can be easily evaluated with minimal computational and conceptual difficulty. Two empirical applications in macroeconomics demonstrate that the methods are versatile and computationally undemanding. In one application, involving a time-varying parameter model, we show that the methods allow for efficient handling of large state vectors. In our second application, involving a dynamic factor model, we introduce a new blocking strategy which results in improved MCMC mixing at little cost. The results demonstrate that the framework is simple, flexible and efficient. }

abstract = {Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models use modern macroeconomic theory to explain and predict comovements of aggregate time series over the business cycle and to perform policy analysis. We explain how to use DSGE models for all three purposes – forecasting, story-telling, and policy experiments – and review their forecasting record. We also provide our own real-time assessment of the forecasting performance of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model data up to 2011, compare it with Blue Chip and Greenbook forecasts, and show how it changes as we augment the standard set of observables with external information from surveys (nowcasts, interest rates, and long-run inflation and output growth expectations). We explore methods of generating forecasts in the presence of a zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates and conditional on counterfactual interest rate paths. Finally, we perform a post-mortem of DSGE model forecasts of the Great Recession, and show that forecasts from a version of the Smets–Wouters model augmented by financial frictions and with interest rate spreads as an observable compare well with Blue Chip forecasts.}
